        <h3>Software University Faculty Parking Policies</h3>
        <p>Faculty and staff are very important to the everyday activity that occurs on the campus of Software University, and convenient parking is crucial to their everyday success. Due to this, Software University has allocated central lots near classes as Faculty & Staff parking lots (indicated green on the Campus Map), ONLY permitting faculty and staff to park. In addition to this, faculty and staff are also allowed to park in any other lot on campus (e.g. Residential, Commuter, and overflow).</p>
