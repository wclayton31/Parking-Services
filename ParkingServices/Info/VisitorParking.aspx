        <h3>Software University Visitor Parking Policies</h3>
        <p>Visitors are welcome on the campus of Software University! All visitors who are not registered with the University must first stop by University Public Safety to pick up a car placard for temporary parking privileges on campus. The placard must be hung from the rear-view mirror of the vehicle where it can be clearly seen. Vehicles parked on campus with neither a University-registered decal or visitor placard will be fined and at risk for towing. Visitors parking is ONLY permitted in overflow lots (indicated orange on the Campus Map), or in spaces designated as “Visitor Parking”.</p>
